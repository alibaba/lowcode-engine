| getPopupContainer | To set the container of the dropdown menu. The default is to create a `div` element in `body`, but you can reset it to the scrolling area and make a relative reposition.

You should use [Menu](/components/menu/) as `overlay`. The menu items and dividers are also available by using `Menu.Item` and `Menu.Divider`.

> Warning: You must set a unique `key` for `Menu.Item`.
