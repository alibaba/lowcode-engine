Handling the overall layout of a page.

## Specification

### Size

The first level navigation is left aligned near a logo, and the secondary menu is right aligned.

- Top Navigation: the height of the first level navigation `64px`, the second level navigation `48px`.
- Top Navigation (for landing pages): the height of the first level navigation `80px`, the second level navigation `56px`.
- Calculation formula of a top navigation: `48+8n`.
- Calculation formula of an aside navigation: `200+8n`.

### Interaction rules

- The first level navigation and the last level navigation should be distinguishable by visualization;
- The current item should have the highest priority of visualization;
- When the current navigation item is collapsed, the style of the current navigation item is applied to its parent level;
- The left side navigation bar has support for both the accordion and expanding styles; you can choose the one that fits your case the best.

## Visualization rules

Style of a navigation should conform to its level.

- **Emphasis by colorblock**

  When background color is a deep color, you can use this pattern for the parent level navigation item of the current page.

- **The highlight match stick**

  When background color is a light color, you can use this pattern for the current page navigation item; we recommend using it for the last item of the navigation path.

- **Highlighted font**

  From the visualization aspect, a highlighted font is stronger than colorblock; this pattern is often used for the parent level of the current item.

- **Enlarge the size of the font**

  `12px`, `14px` is a standard font size of navigations, `14px` is used for the first and the second level of the navigation. You can choose an appropriate font size regarding the level of your navigation.

## Component Overview

- `Layout`: The layout wrapper, in which `Header` `Sider` `Content` `Footer` or `Layout` itself can be nested, and can be placed in any parent container.
- `Header`: The top layout with the default style, in which any element can be nested, and must be placed in `Layout`.
- `Sider`: The sidebar with default style and basic functions, in which any element can be nested, and must be placed in `Layout`.
- `Content`: The content layout with the default style, in which any element can be nested, and must be placed in `Layout`.
- `Footer`: The bottom layout with the default style, in which any element can be nested, and must be placed in `Layout`.

> Based on `flex layout`, please pay attention to the [compatibility](http://caniuse.com/#search=flex).
