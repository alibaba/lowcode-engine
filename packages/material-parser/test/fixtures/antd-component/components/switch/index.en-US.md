Switching Selector.

## When To Use

- If you need to represent the switching between two states or on-off state.
- The difference between `Switch` and `Checkbox` is that `Switch` will trigger a state change directly when you toggle it, while `Checkbox` is generally used for state marking, which should work in conjunction with submit operation.
